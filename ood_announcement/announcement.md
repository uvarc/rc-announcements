**NOTICE:** 2023-10-04 10:08:53 Rivanna is back in service following maintenance, but Project and Oldscratch (GPFS) storage remain offline while engineers work to restore the performance of the system. Restoration was faster during maintenance and has reached 50% completion so the decision was taken to keep it inaccessible until it is stable. For details see [here](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/).
