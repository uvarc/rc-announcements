Welcome to UVA’s High-Performance Computing environment!

Please give the system one hour to update before attempting to use your new allocation. You may use your allocation for the Afton or Rivanna systems.

New users are encouraged to attend one of our "Intro to HPC" orientation sessions which are held on Wednesdays at 3 p.m. EST (to reserve a seat, go to  https://www.rc.virginia.edu/support/#new-to-high-performance-computing and click on the "Sign up" button).

A helpful overview of the system, how to log in, and how to use the compute resources are available on the high-performance computing webpage:
https://www.rc.virginia.edu/userinfo/hpc/overview/

Need more help? Please [contact our user services team](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/support/).

Please note that Research Computing (RC) resources are for UVA faculty, staff, students and sponsored collaborators conducting academic research only; personal use is not allowed, and all users must follow university policies.

By logging in to the Afton/Rivanna HPC system, you accept Research Computing’s terms of service as detailed below:

- Permissible Data
Only public, internal, sensitive, or de-identified data may be used; highly sensitive data are strictly prohibited.

- System Availability & Maintenance
While RC strives for high availability, outages and scheduled maintenance may occur, and users will be notified in advance of planned downtime.

- Login (Access) Nodes Usage
Login nodes are for light, interactive work only; running compute-intensive jobs or exceeding time limits can result in terminated processes and possible loss of access. We have a dedicated partition for testing and short runs called the “interactive” partition. See here for details https://www.rc.virginia.edu/userinfo/hpc/overview/#job-queues.

- Scratch Directory Policy
Scratch storage is temporary (10 TB per user), not backed up, and files unused for 90 days are automatically deleted to maintain performance.

- Software License Fair Use
Excessive use of licensed software that impacts others may result in job termination, with or without warning.

- Communications from RC
Users agree to receive RC communications related to policies, system status, and other essential information.

- Inappropriate or Prohibited Usage
Violations of university security policies or use of prohibited applications (e.g., TikTok, WeChat, DeepSeek) will result in immediate termination of access.
 
At your service,
Research Computing (RC)
